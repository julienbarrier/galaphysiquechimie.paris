**This section covers the approved _action labels_ and _idioms_ for use in the Bluemix UI and documentation. Users rely on consistent labels for common actions to predict how to interact with an interface. Idioms are expressions that have a meaning different from the meaning of each word in the expression.**

This section is a living document. When new terms are introduced, they will be added here. If you're looking for the product glossary, go to <a href="https://new-console.ng.bluemix.net/docs/overview/glossary/index.html" target=blank>Glossary terms for Bluemix.</a>
