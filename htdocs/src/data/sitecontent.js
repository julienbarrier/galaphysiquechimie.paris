There is also an unofficial [Angular library](https://pages.github.ibm.com/adaniel/angular-carbon-components/) for Carbon Components that is managed by an external team.**\n\n## Carbon support\nThe table below shows the Carbon team's level of support for the Core library vs. the Add-ons repo.\n\n|                  | Core library      | Add-ons   |\n|------------------|-------------------|-----------|\n| General design questions  |  ✅      | ✅         |\n| Design feedback & support |  ✅      |            |\n| Troubleshooting           |  ✅      | ✅         |\n| Bug fixes                 |  ✅      |            |\n\n## Contributing to Add-ons\nAdd-ons are generally easier to contribute to because they are not fully managed by the Carbon team.

Use verbs that describe the action, such as **Add** or **Delete**. Use sentence-style capitalization (only the first word in a phrase and any proper nouns capitalized) and no more than three words for button labels.\n\nFor Sets of Buttons, use specific labels, such as **Save** or **Discard**, instead of using **OK** and **Cancel**. This is particularly helpful when the user is confirming an action.\n\nFor consistency, see [labels and idioms](/guidelines/content/glossary) for the approved list of action labels.\n\n## Icon usage\n\n* Use glyphs (16px) within buttons.\n* Glyphs are distinguished by their solid shape and knocked-out details.\n* Glyphs should always appear to the right of the text.\n* Glyphs used in buttons must be directly related to the action that the user is taking.\n* Glyphs must be the same color value as the text within a button.\n* Ghost buttons require a glyph icon (cannot be stand alone text because of poor affordance).\n\n\n![button with glyph](images/button-usage-1.png)\n_Glyph usage in Buttons_\n"

We recommend using <a href=\"https://chriskempson.github.io/base16/\" target=blank>Base16</a> for more complex syntax highlighting. Base16 provides carefully chosen syntax highlighting and a default set of sixteen colors suitable for a wide range of applications. The theme we recommend using is **Solarflare**.\n\n### Overflow\n\nIf there are more than nine lines of code, apply vertical scrolling to the Code Snippet.\n\nTerminal commands are often longer strings and should only appear on one line. Apply horizontal scrolling to maintain the set width of the box for those longer strings.\n\n## Interaction\n\nCode Snippets are accompanied by a **Copy icon**, which allows users to copy the provided code to their clipboard. The copy icon must be accompanied by a confirmation that states the successful action of copying an item to the users clipboard.\n\n![code snippet example](images/code-snippet-usage-1.png)\n"

    "content": "## Basic Data Table\nThe Data Table component is designed in a way for additional functionality to be added on to fit your team's needs.\n\nThe basic Data Table is shipped with a base style, which includes:\n\n* Borders\n* No zebra striping, row dividers instead.\n* No Pagination, Search, Table toolbar, or multi-select\n\n![basic data table](images/data-table-usage-1.png)\n\n_Basic Data Table_\n\n\n## Additonal functionality\nThe following can be added to the Data Table to increase its functionality.\n\n### Pagination\nPagination divides table data into separate pages. Pagination is accompanied by an option that enables the user to change the number of items per page. See the [Pagination](/components/Pagination) component for further guidelines.\n\n![data table with pagination](images/data-table-usage-2.png)\n\n_Data Table with various Pagination methods_\n\n\n### Search\nSearch returns results based on matches. It is used to locate and display a set of results. Search functionality within a table follows [Small search](/components/search) conventions. Search should be open by default, and live below the table title.\n\n![data table with search](images/data-table-usage-3.png)\n_Search on Data Tables_\n\n### Sorting\nImprove table usability by making data sortable. Clickable headers enable users to sort table data up or down. The specific attribute being sorted is accompanied by a caret icon. The caret will only appear on the column headers once that particular column is being sorted. You can see a demo of this on Carbon's [Codepen.](https://codepen.io/tjegan/pen/PjjyVN)\n\n\n### Table toolbar\nThe table toolbar is reserved for global table actions such as table settings, complex filter, export, or editing table data. Additional options can be added if you have an icon to support that function. Icons should be 16x16 px (glyphs). We recommend using no more than 5 icons within the table toolbar.\n\n![Table toolbar](images/data-table-usage-6.png)\n_Table toolbar: Table settings_\n\n### Multi-select / Batch action\nBatch actions are functions that may be performed on multiple items within a table. Once the user selects more than one row from the table, the **batch action bar** appears at the top of the table, presenting the user with actions they can take. To exit or escape \"batch action mode,\" the user can cancel out or deselect the items.  \n\n![Batch action mode](images/data-table-usage-7.png)\n_Batch action mode on Data Tables_\n\n### Inline actions\nInline actions are functions that may be performed on a specific table item. Each row is accompanied by an [Overflow menu](/components/overflow-menu) that contains actions related specifically to that table row.\n\n![Inline action on Data Table](images/data-table-usage-8.png)\n_Inline actions on Data Tables_\n"

It can be formatted in a variety of ways. See the Date Picker code [documentation](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-components/tree/master/src/components/date-picker) for more info.\n\n\n## Interaction\n### Calendar widget\nIt is recommended to use the Date Picker with a calendar widget when the user is browsing between a range of dates. We can aid the user in making the proper choices by providing a visual reference of dates for them to choose from. The calendar widget appears once the user has interacted with the date input field (typically on `:focus`).\n\n\n![Selecting a dates from the Range Date Picker](images/date-picker-usage-4.gif)\n\n_Selecting dates from the Range Date Picker_\n\n### Simple Date Picker\nThe Simple Date Picker provides the user with a text input in which they can input month/day/year. Simple Date Pickers are typically used when the date is known by the user, such as a birthday or credit card expiration.\n\n## Time Picker\nTime pickers provide the user with a text input in which they can input hours/minutes. Additionally, they can be accompanied by an “AM/PM” selection and a time zone selection, which is styled as an [Inline Select](/components/select).\n\n---\n***\n> \n![Time picker example](images/time-picker-usage-1.png)\n\n_Time picker used to set deployment time_\n"

Do not use multiple lines of text, images, or icons within a Dropdown. Sort the items in logical order, such as grouping related options together.\n\n### Length\n\nKeep Dropdown options succinct. Long Dropdowns that require scrolling make it difficult for users to see all their options in one glance.\n\n## Interaction\n\nDropdowns should appear on click rather than on hover. Hover-activated Dropdowns increase cognitive load on users and are not recommended due to usability issues. Dropdowns should appear above all other elements within the UI. They can be dismissed by clicking outside of the dropdown item or on the parent element. Selecting an item from the dropdown will also dismiss it.\n\n## Usage\n\nA Dropdown may be used to filter a set of data.\n\n![dropdown as a filter](images/dropdown-usage-1.png)\n\n![dropdown as a filter](images/dropdown-usage-2.png)\n\n![dropdown as a filter](images/dropdown-usage-3.png)\n_Dropdown to filter table data_\n"

    "content": "## Effective form design\n\nAll forms are comprised of 5 elements:\n\n* **Labels:** Inform users what the corresponding input fields mean.\n* **Input fields:** Enable users to provide information. Information can be entered through a variety of different input fields ranging from text fields, checkboxes, and many other types.\n* **Placeholder text:** Provides assistance on how to fill out a field.\n* **Actions:** Allow users to submit a form.\n* **Validation:** Ensures the data submitted by the user conforms to acceptable parameters.\n\n![effective form design](images/form-usage-1.png)\n\n## Form logic\n\n* **Radio Buttons** are used when there is a list of two or more options that are mutually exclusive and the user must select exactly one choice. In other words, clicking a non-selected radio button will deselect whatever other button was previously selected in the list.\n* **Checkboxes** are used when there are lists of options and the user may select any number of choices, including zero, one, or several. In other words, each checkbox is independent of all other checkboxes in the list, so checking one box doesn’t uncheck the others. A stand-alone checkbox, or a toggle can be used for a single option that the user can turn on or off.\n* For fields in which a single selection is required and there are a large number of possible options, consider using a **Select** element.\n\n![form logic](images/form-usage-4.png)\n\n## General guidelines\n\n### Keep it short\n\nBe as concise as possible when designing forms. Think about each field and what value the data will provide. What do you gain by collecting this information?\n\n**Begin by asking:**\n\n* Is this a piece of information that is valuable to us?\n* Is this a piece of information that is so valuable that it's worth preventing the user from continuing if they choose not to provide it?\n\n## Validation and errors\n\n### Error messaging\n\nEffective error messaging can help the user to understand the problem and how to fix it. First, inform the user what has happened, then provide guidance on next steps or possible resolutions. [Inline Notifications](/components/notification) can be used to state the general problem with the users input, such as _“Please input the required fields.”_ Inline Notifications can occur pre or post submission, depending on the type of data the user is inputting.\n\n![Inline notification on forms](images/form-usage-2.png)\n_Inline Notification for error messaging_\n\n### Form validation\n\nWe recommend validating the users data before form submission. Use visual cues to guide the user as to where the problem lies within the form. This will help to easily identify the elements that need to be corrected.\n\nThe validation should appear when the user has clicked away from the text field. Once the user corrects the errors within the text field, the validation should disappear once the data is rendered as valid.\n\nThe validation label below the field should be as informative as possible when describing the issue with the users data. For example, if password limitations require 16 characters, but the user inputs a password with only six characters, the text should read something like, _\"Password must be at least 16 characters.\"_\n\n![form validation](images/form-usage-3.gif)\n_Form validation_\n\n### Optional vs. required fields\nAll fields in a form are assumed required, with optional fields being tagged as so.\n\n![optional fields in a form](images/form-usage-5.png)\n_Denote optional fields within a Form_\n"

Headers include a close button “x” in the upper right-hand corner of the Modal.\n\n### Body\n\nThe body content within a Modal should be as minimal as possible. Components that may be used in Modals include: Form fields, Text Area, Select, and Radio Buttons.\n\n### Footer\n\nThe footer area of a Modal typically contains a set of buttons. Refer to [Button](/components/button) guidelines for usage.\n\n## Usage\n\n### Transactional Modal\n\nTransactional Modals are used to validate user decisions or to gain secondary confirmation from the user. Typically, the Modal requests either a 'yes' or 'no' response.\n\n![transactional modal](images/modal-usage-1.png)\n\n### Passive Modal\n\nThis Modal is used as a style of notifications. We highly discourage the use of this, due to its disruptive nature. Passive Modal notifications should only appear if there is an action the user needs to address immediately. Passive Modal notifications are persistent on-screen. That is, they do not automatically go away after appearing. Users must either engage with or dismiss the notification.\n\n![Passive modal](images/modal-usage-3.png)\n\n### Input Modal\n\nModals used in this case include input areas that the user may interact with. These may include but are not limited to Forms, Dropdowns, Selectors, and Links.\n\n![input modal](images/modal-usage-2.png)\n"

Be descriptive and include any troubleshooting actions or next steps. When possible, communicate the main message using just the title. You can include [Links](/components/link) within the Notification body that redirect the user to next steps.\n\n### Dismissal\n\nWe recommend that Toast Notifications automatically disappear after five seconds. Inline Notifications are persistent until the user dismisses them. All notifications have at least one method of dismissal (typically, it is a small “x” in the upper right hand corner).\n\n### Icons\n\nIcons may provide additional clarity. Icons should be placed to the left of a title.

Indicate to the user that they are performing a multi-step process, and show the direction of movement. Allow the user to return to a previous step to review their data submission.\n\n### Indicate the current step\n\nKeeping the user informed of where they currently are within the process or task at hand will give them a sense of control. This helps the user to know where they are in relation to where they have been, and what sections are to follow. Clear labels should accompany the Progress Indicator to indicate what the user will accomplish within each step. Keep labels between one to two words.\n\n### Validation\n\nUse validation to confirm that a previous step has been completed. If the user cannot proceed onto another step without first completing a task, use an [Inline Notification](/components/notification) to inform them.\n\n![Progress Indicator example](images/progress-indicator-usage-1.png)\n_In-context Progress Indicator_\n"

When using a Small select for a number selection, the increments in the select should be 10, 25, 50 and 100. The maximum amount of items a user can see per page is 100.\n\n---\n***\n> \n![example of Small select in Data Table](images/select-usage-3.png)\n\n_Example of Small select in Data Table_\n\n### Inline select\nInline select is useful when you have multiple `select` fields within a form. Inline selects have less visual weight on a page, since stylistically they are borderless.\n\n---\n***\n> \n![example of inline select](images/select-usage-4.png)\n\n_Example of Inline select_\n\n<br>\n\n## General guidelines\n\n### Labels\n\nLabels are essential to the usability of forms because they provide guidance to the data a user might provide. Do not place a label inside a Select element. Use sentence case and no more than three words.\n\n### Validation\n\nReal time validation helps to streamline the process and keep data clean when the user is filling out forms. For full guidelines, refer to the [Forms](/components/form) usage page.\n\n---\n***\n> \n![validation on select element](images/select-usage-1.png)\n_Validation on Select_\n\n### Order\n\nThe order of the Select list should be based on the frequency of use. If applicable, the list should be in increasing order relative to the content. In cases of Forms, alternative orders such as alphabetical may be more fitting. A horizontal rule can be used to group similar items together.\n\n\n\n## Accessibility\n\n### Styling Select dropdowns\n\nIt is strongly recommended not to style Select dropdowns due to accessibility purposes.\nOne of the <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/G202.html\" target=blank>WCAG 2.0 standards</a> for accessibility is “Ensuring keyboard control for all functionality.” CSS alternatives to `select` elements to not meet this requirement.\n\nWhile you can make a Select element easily usable by a mouse, making it usable with keyboard navigation is complex. The default `select` element should follow this process:\n\n|         | Mouse                                    | Keyboard                                            |\n|---------|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|\n| :hover  | move your cursor over the select element | use the tab key to focus the select element         |\n| :focus  | click on the select element              | press enter                                         |\n| :       | move your cursor over the desired option | use the top and bottom arrow keys to pick an option |\n| :select | click on the desired option              | press enter                                         |\n"

In this case it is not necessary for a user to choose a specific value, but instead generally increase or decrease an input. For example, the user increases the Slider amount and the volume of the music gets louder.

Make sure to set the step size increments to reasonable values.\n* ↑ ↓ ← → changes the value by one step size increment.

Using a placeholder text as a label is often applied as a space-saving method. However, this is not recommended because it hides context and presents accessibility issues.\n\n**Accessibility best practices for labels:**\n\n* Labels must be visible when an input gets focus.\n* Labels must be announced to the screen reader on focus.\n* Ensure the helper text that appears under an input is read when an assistive technology user stops at an input using ARIA.\n* Use sentence-style capitalization (only the first word in a phrase and any proper nouns capitalized).\n\n### Placeholder text\n\nPlaceholder text provides hints or examples of what to enter. Placeholder text should disappear after the user has entered data into the Text Input. Use sentence-style capitalization, and in most cases, write the text as full sentences with punctuation.\n\n---\n***\n> \n![Placeholder text](images/text-input-usage-1.png)\n\n### Default values\n\nWhere possible, add programmatic assistance. Detect and pre-fill inputs to reduce errors and save time. When the software can't determine the value that belongs in an input, use type-ahead to make suggestions. Use sentence-case for default values, detected values, and auto-completion text.\n\n### Validation and errors\n\nReal time validation helps to streamline the process and keep data clean when the user is filling out forms. For full guidelines, refer to the [Forms](/components/form/usage) usage page.\n\n---\n***\n> \n![validation on text field](images/text-input-usage-2.png)\n_Text Input validation_\n"

    "content": "## Usage\nTiles provide a diverse method for displaying information. The type of content within a Tile can range from informational, to getting started, how-to, and next steps. Content that is specifically related to users data (metrics, activity log) should be housed in a [Module](/components/module).  \n\nCarbon ships a basic Tile structure that responds to the grid. Tiles have no pre-set styles for the content within them. You can customize Tiles to fit your specific use case.\n\nWhen using a call to action (CTA) within a Tile, we recommend using a [Secondary Button](/components/button). Primary Buttons should be reserved for the most important action a user can take on the page.\n\n## Types of Tiles\n_All of the images below represent an example of what type of content could be presented within a Tile. These are the styling choices we recommend, but you are free to create your own layout and design within a Tile._\n\n### Read-only\nRead-only Tiles are used to display information to the user, such as features or services offered. Read-only Tiles are often seen on marketing pages to promote content. These Tiles can have internal calls-to-action (CTAs), such as a [Button](/components/button) or a [Link](/components/link).\n\n![Read-only tile](images/tile-usage-1.png)\n\n### Clickable\nClickable Tiles can be used as navigational items, where the entire Tile is a clickable state, which redirects the user to a new page. Clickable Tiles cannot contain internal CTAs.\n\n![Clickable tile](images/tile-usage-2.png)\n\n### Selectable\nSelectable Tiles work like a [Radio Button](/components/radio-button), where the entire Tile is a click target. Selectable Tiles may contain internal CTAs (like links to docs) if the internal CTA is given its own click target. Selectable Tiles work well for presenting options to a user in a structured manner, such as a set of pricing plans.\n\n![Selectable tile](images/tile-usage-3.png)\n\n### Expandable\nExpandable Tiles are helpful for hiding/showing larger amounts of content to a user. They can only be stacked in a single column, and cannot live in a row or horizontal grid. When expanded, Tiles push content down the page. Expandable Tiles may contain internal CTAs (like links to docs) if the internal CTA is given its own click target.\n\n\n![Expadable tile](images/tile-usage-4.png)\n"

    "content": "### What is the Carbon Design System?\nCarbon is the design system for IBM Cloud products. It is a series of individual styles, components, and guidelines used for creating unified UI.\n\n### Who works on the Carbon Design System?\nCarbon has a [core team](https://github.com/orgs/carbon-design-system/people) of designers and front-end developers that are dedicated to developing and supporting the system. Our core team sits in the IBM Design Studio in Austin, Texas. There are also countless other designers and developers who also contribute back to [carbon-components](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-components#contributors) and [carbon-react](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-components-react#contributors).\n\n### How can I contribute and/or propose new components/ideas?\nWe have guidelines for contributing back to [Carbon Components](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-components/blob/master/docs/contributing.md) and the [Carbon Design assets](http://carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/contributing). We appreciate you helping out and contributing back.\n\n### Which browsers are supported?\nCarbon components is supported in the following browsers:\n\n- IE11\n- IE Edge latest\n- Firefox latest\n- Chrome latest\n- Safari latest\n\n### What language are the components written in?\nThere are two different implementations of the Carbon Design System. One is a Vanilla.js library; that's written in ES6+, SCSS, and HTML and ships deliverables in vanilla javascript in ES5 as well as ES6, CSS, SCSS, and HTML. The other is a React library, that ships a React rewrite of the javascript, but uses the same CSS as the core library.\n\nThere is also an unofficial, internal-only [Angular library](https://pages.github.ibm.com/adaniel/angular-carbon-components/) for Carbon Components that was built out by a team other than Carbon. Please note that we **do not** maintain this repo.\n\n### I see a bug, how do I report it?\nPlease open an issue in the appropriate [GitHub repo](https://github.com/carbon-design-system). We will address the bug as soon as we can. If you have a fix for the bug please feel free to submit a PR for it.\n\n### Why hasn't my bug been fixed yet?\nIf you have a pressing bug or change it is best to make PR for the issue yourself. Our team works in sprints and will try to address your bug as soon as possible, usually by the following sprint. Issues that are out of scope will be closed until it becomes a higher priority.\n\n### I haven't updated to the latest version of Carbon yet, but I still need the old documentation. Is there a place I can find it?\n\nEvery version of Carbon that is still supported is hosted at its own domain. You can find the old **[V6](http://v6.carbondesignsystem.com/)** and **[V7](http://v7.carbondesignsystem.com/)** sites here.\n\n\n\n### Where do I go if I've read everything and still have an issue/question?\nIf you still have questions or can't find the answer you are looking for feel free to reach out in one of the following ways:\n\n**General inquiries**\n\nEmail: carbon@us.ibm.com </br>\nTwitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/_carbondesign\" target=\"_blank\">@_carbondesign</a>\n\n**Slack channels (IBM internal only)**\n\nFor design questions: #carbon-design-system </br>\nFor developer questions: #carbon-components, #carbon-react\n\n**GitHub repos**\n\nOpen an issue in one of our <a href=\"https://github.com/carbon-design-system\">GitHub repos</a>.

These styles are meant to cascade down to everything in `<body>` to set common styles shared across all components.\n\n```css\nbody {\n  @include reset;\n  font-family: 'ibm-plex-sans';\n  color: $text-01;\n  background-color: $ui-02;\n  line-height: 1;\n}\n```\n\n**Icons**: A lot of components depend on SVG icons from [carbon-icons](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-icons). Read the [docs](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-icons/blob/master/docs/usage.md) for details on how to use them.\n\n**Global SCSS variables**: These variables are used to configure which parts of the SCSS get compiled, where each variable controls a SCSS file of the same name. All variables are set to `true` by default, except for `_css--font-face.scss`\n\nFor example:\n\n- When you set `$css--reset: true`, then the contents of [_css--reset.scss](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-components/blob/master/src/globals/scss/_css--reset.scss) will be part of your output CSS.\n- When you set `$css--reset: false`, then nothing gets included from that SCSS file.\n- When the variable is not declared at all, then nothing gets included from that SCSS file.\n\nThe same rules apply to all the following variables:\n\n```scss\n// In styles.scss:\n// These are the default settings.\n$css--font-face: false !default;\n$css--helpers: true !default;\n$css--body: true !default;\n$css--use-layer: true !default;\n$css--reset: true !default;\n$css--typography: true !default;\n```\n\nThese flags are set for you by default when you `@import` the `styles.scss` file.\nYou can override these default settings by redeclaring the variables.\n\n#### Importing SCSS files\n\nTo add a component style to your build, simply import the component directly.\n\n```js\n@import 'node_modules/carbon-components/scss/components/card/card';\n```\n\nImporting a component this way will bring in any dependencies that component has as well. The import system removes duplicate dependencies, so shared dependencies between components will not create extra CSS.\n\n#### Namespacing\n\nCarbon Components are built to be included individually and not clobber global styles - all `class` attributes are prefixed by the `bx--` moniker.\n\n## Javascript\n\n### Using a module bundler: recommended\n\nUsing a module bundler will bring in only the component code your application needs, creating an optimized build for production. Carbon Components ships with a `umd` build for each component, as well as a `js:next` build for use with webpack 2 or rollup. After you've installed the components through `npm`, there are a few ways to initialize the component.\n\n#### Initialize all instances of a component using a module bundler\n\n```js\nimport { Modal } from 'carbon-components'\nModal.init();\n```\n\n#### Initialize a specific instance\n\n```js\nimport { Modal } from 'carbon-components';\nconst myModal = document.querySelector('[data-modal]'); // element node of the modal itself\nModal.init(myModal);\n```\n\n#### Reference a previously initialized component using a module bundler\n\n```js\nimport { Modal } from 'carbon-components';\nconst myModal = document.querySelector('[data-modal]');\nconst myModalInstance = Modal.components.get(myModal);\n```\n\n### Using the compiled carbon-components file directly\n\nUsers can also opt to use the pre-compiled `carbon-components.js` file directly. We recommend that most users do _not_ use this file, as it includes components your application may or may not actually be using. By default, including the javascript file will automatically instantiate any component on the page as well as create a global objected called `CarbonComponents`.\n\n#### Initialize all instances of a component using the compiled file directly\n\n```html\n<html>\n  <body>\n    <!-- Put HTML snippets of components here... -->\n    <script src=\"node_modules/carbon-components/scripts/carbon-components.min.js\"></script>\n  </body>\n</html>\n```\n\n#### Don't initialize components by default\n\n```html\n<html>\n  <body>\n    <!-- Put HTML snippets of components here... -->\n    <script src=\"node_modules/carbon-components/scripts/carbon-components.min.js\"></script>\n    <script>\n      CarbonComponents.settings.disableAutoInit = true;\n    </script>\n  </body>\n</html>\n```\n\n#### Initialize a specific component\n\n```html\n<html>\n  <body>\n    <!-- Put a HTML snippet from http://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/modal/code here -->\n    <script src=\"node_modules/carbon-components/scripts/carbon-components.min.js\"></script>\n    <script>\n      CarbonComponents.settings.disableAutoInit = true;\n      var modal = document.querySelector('[data-modal]');\n      CarbonComponents.Modal.init(modal);\n    </script>\n  </body>\n</html>\n```\n\n#### Reference a previously initialized component using the compiled file directly\n\n```html\n<html>\n  <body>\n    <!-- Put a HTML snippet from http://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/modal/code here -->\n    <script src=\"node_modules/carbon-components/scripts/carbon-components.min.js\"></script>\n    <script>\n      var modal = document.querySelector('[data-modal]');\n      var myModalRef = CarbonComponents.Modal.components.get(modal);\n    </script>\n  </body>\n</html>\n```\n\n### Wrapping a component with JavaScript framework of your choice\n\nMany JavaScript frameworks have a mechanism to automatically create/destroy DOM elements, for example, upon change in array.\nCarbon Components defined in DOM elements that are created after the `DOMContentLoaded` event, like ones such JavaScript frameworks create upon change in array, need to be initialized (and released) manually.\n\nThe easiest way to manually initialize/release components is defining a \"wrapping component\", with the JavaScript framework of your choice. Here's an example using Web Components' [Custom Elements v1 spec](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Custom_Elements), but the notion of components, along with the lifecycle callbacks, are commonly found in many other JavaScript frameworks.\n\n```javascript\nclass BXLoading extends HTMLElement {\n  // Called when this custom element gets into render tree\n  connectedCallback() {\n    // \"this\" here is \"<bx-loading>\" element\n    this.innerHTML = '(e.g. snippet from http://carbondesignsystem.com/components/loading/code)';\n    this.loading = CarbonComponents.Loading.create(this.querySelector('[data-loading]'));\n  }\n  // Called when this custom element gets out of render tree\n  disconnectedCallback() {\n    this.loading.release();\n  }\n}\ncustomElements.define('bx-loading', BXLoading);\n```\n\n### Polyfills for older browsers\n\ncarbon-components requires some polyfills for older browsers, in addition to carbon-components.js (or carbon-components.min.js).\nThe latest list of polyfills is maintained in https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-components/blob/master/demo/polyfills/index.js.\nYou can easily find the polyfills in NPM, etc. The current list is below:\n\n* [`Array.from()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/from)\n* [`Math.sign()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/sign)\n* [`Object.assign()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/assign)\n* [`CustomEvent`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CustomEvent/CustomEvent)\n* [`Element#closest()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/es/docs/Web/API/Element/closest)\n* [`Element#matches()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/matches)\n* [2nd arg of `Element.classList.toggle()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/classList#Methods)\n"

    "content": "## Introduction\n\nThe IBM Cloud platform is a collection of behaviors and capabilities that are tied together through the IBM Cloud console. Fully participatory services share capabilities and tooling to ensure a professional, performant, consistent, and cohesive platform experience.\n\nThis document will guide you through the design and implementation of your service as part of the IBM Cloud Platform. It will provide instructions for specific aspects of the presentation layer, such as using Carbon and creating your service icons. Additionally, it will enumerate the requirements for Service Governance approvers and the process to get that approval. Following this guidance and execution steps will ensure the design portion of the approval process is straightforward.\n\n\nServices must adopt these foundational capabilities to actively participate in the IBM Cloud platform:\n\n* [RC (Resource Controller)](https://console.stage1.bluemix.net/docs/developing/resource-controller/overview.html#resource-controller): Manage the lifecycle of cloud resources using this next-generation provisioning layer.\n* [Bluemix Console SDK](https://console.stage1.bluemix.net/docs/developing/console-sdk/index.html#getting-started): Learn how to develop your service as a microservice so that it will seamlessly integrate into the IBM Cloud platform.  \n* [IAM (Identity and Access Management)](https://console.stage1.bluemix.net/docs/developing/Access-Management/index.html#iam_features): Securely authenticate users and control access to all cloud resources consistently. Learn how to onboard your service to IAM [here](https://console.stage1.bluemix.net/docs/developing/Access-Management/checklist_overview.html#getting-started-onboarding-overview).\n* [BSS (Business Support Systems)](https://console.stage1.bluemix.net/docs/services/onboarding/new_service.html#onboarding-a-new-service-into-bluemix): Develop your pricing plan in RMC (Resource Management Console) by enabling [Metering](https://console.stage1.bluemix.net/docs/developing/metering/index.html#reporting_resource_usage) so IBM Cloud users are billed according to usage data.\n* [GhoST (Global Search and Tagging System)](https://console.stage1.bluemix.net/docs/developing/GhoST/onboard.html#getting-started): Add resource types so they are visible in the IBM Cloud filesystem to better enable platform-wide search. Follow [these instructions](https://ibm.ent.box.com/s/qopacahpyg34z2urevv74mter742yfse) to onboard a new resource type. For more help, contact someone via Slack at [#global-search-tagging](https://ibm-cloudplatform.slack.com/messages/C11F8KA1Z/details/).\n* [Global Catalog](https://console.stage1.bluemix.net/docs/developing/resource-catalog/index.html#global_catalog_overview): Record and manage your cloud offering across geographies.\n* [Documentation](https://console.stage1.bluemix.net/docs/developing/writing/index.html#get-started): Compose content for each phase of your offering and continually update as your service pushes new changes.\n* [Carbon Design System](http://carbondesignsystem.com/): Use Carbon as a resource for code, visual, and UX guidance when developing components and creating your service icon.\n\n\n## Onboarding requirements\n\nOnboard your service to IBM Cloud by fulfilling the following requirements. Design approval is required for each phase of the process including Experimental, Beta, GA, and post GA iterations.\n\n<!--### Index resources\n* Add resource types to GhoST so they are visible in the IBM Cloud filesystem. Indexing should include performance stats (such as request volume, response time, and error rate), period billing to-date, and linked support issues.\n* Follow [these instructions](https://ibm.ent.box.com/s/qopacahpyg34z2urevv74mter742yfse) to onboard a new resource type. For more help, contact someone via Slack at [#global-search-tagging](https://ibm-cloudplatform.slack.com/messages/C11F8KA1Z/details/).-->\n\n### Enable NPS\n* NPS (Net Promoter Score) is a management tool that measures customer relationships. To enable in-product NPS data collection for your service, follow [these instructions](https://pages.github.ibm.com/Bluemix/platform-analytics/data/nps/).\n\n### Use Carbon\n* Leverage the Carbon Design System for visual and user experience guidance. By utilizing the [Carbon Component Library](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-components), your development team can easily implement ready-made components to create comprehensive UI.\n* If you are new to Carbon, get started as a [designer](http://carbondesignsystem.com/getting-started/designers) or [developer](http://carbondesignsystem.com/getting-started/developers), and check the [FAQ's](http://carbondesignsystem.com/getting-started/FAQ) to learn more.\n\n### Confirm accessibility\nYour service UI (e.g. Configuration, Dashboard) should follow [WCAG AA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/) gudielines. All Carbon components are designed to meet accessibility standards. However, if components are customized the designs must:\n\n* Pass [color contrast ratios](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/visual-audio-contrast-contrast.html) and meet [color usage](http://carbondesignsystem.com/style/colors/usage) guidelines, which include type color combinations and [data visualization](http://carbondesignsystem.com/data-vis/overview/colors) best practices. If necessary, use a [color contrast checker](https://marijohannessen.github.io/color-contrast-checker/) to verify your design.\n* Follow common [accessibility patterns](http://carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/accessibility), such as keyboard tabbing, focus states, and nagivation order.\n\n<!--* Does your design consider [color usage](http://carbondesignsystem.com/style/colors/usage) and pass the [color contrast ratio](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/visual-audio-contrast-contrast.html)? -->\n\n### Service icon\nReview the [service icon guidelines](/getting-started/service-providers/service-icon) for information on the design, production, approval, and submission of service icons.\n\n### IBM Cloud UI\n#### IBM Cloud Platform\nLearn about the IBM Cloud Platform, including how the console works, plugin requirements for microservices, and more [here](https://console.stage1.bluemix.net/docs/developing/console-sdk/global-console.html#bluemix-global-console-overview). Every service should be navigable within the platform and does not launch out to a separate browser tab or window.\n\n#### Service Configuration Page\nA configuration page describes a service to potential customers. It may include but is not limited to the product description, images of the product, and the pricing table. Using Carbon components, create a configuration page that best characterizes your service.\n\n![Service configuration page](images/sp-config-1.png)\n\n#### Service Dashboard\nService Dashboards display information and details of an existing instance. Using Carbon components, create a dashboard that works for your service.\n\n![Service dashboard](images/sp-dashboard-1.png)\n![Service dashboard2](images/sp-dashboard-2.png)\n\n#### Common Header\nIBM Cloud and its products share a global header with composable variations. See the [Add-ons](carbondesignsystem.com/add-ons/header/code) library to learn more about its behavior and consume the component.\n\n![IBM generic header](images/sp-header-1.png)\n![IBM Cloud header](images/sp-header-2.png)\n\n\n## Resources\n* [Developing in IBM Cloud](https://console.stage1.bluemix.net/docs/developing/index.html)\n* [IBM Cloud Console SDK](https://console.stage1.bluemix.net/docs/developing/console-sdk/index.html#getting-started)\n* [Service onboarding](https://console.stage1.bluemix.net/onboarding/login)\n* [IBM Cloud onboarding FAQs](https://apps.na.collabserv.com/wikis/home?lang=en-us#!/wiki/We288cdeb7a36_44d6_aeb9_a4c703715b90/page/FAQs)\n"

    "content": "## Design guidelines\nYour design team has complete control over your icon's design. We recommend that all icons try to look and feel like IBM, or reflect your product portfolios style. Below are some best practices to consider when making your service's icon.\n\n### Do:\n\n- Get creative\n- Keep it simple\n- Be symmetrical\n- Use a bold line weight/stroke\n- Use two similar colors to create depth and value\n- Draw vectors to be whole pixels\n- Make the icon pixel perfect\n\n### Don't:\n\n- Use gradients\n- Use drop shadows\n- Use a color background\n- Use lines or strokes less than 1 pixel (px)\n- Add internal padding\n\n### Color\nIf you have multiple services, you should either use the same icon with a different color for each service or use the same color scheme for each distinct icon. The examples here show how a row of services from the same provider could look in the catalog. Refer to the [IBM Design Language](https://www.ibm.com/design/language/resources/color-library) color palette for color inspiration and accessibility guidelines.\n\n![Multiple services in the Bluemix catalog A](images/service-providers-1.svg)\n![Multiple services in the Bluemix catalog B](images/service-providers-3.svg)\n\n### Size\n\nOnly one SVG is required of your service icon for production purposes. It should be submitted at the dimensions of `32 x 32` px.\n\n## Production guidelines\n### Icon requirements\n\n<p>1. SVG is sized at 32 x 32 pixels.</p>\n\n<div data-insert-component=\"DosAndDonts5\"></div>\n\n<p>2. All vectors should be squarely on the pixel grid (completing requirements 3-6 will help with this but if you need further help check out the FAQ section at the bottom of this page).</p>\n\n<div data-insert-component=\"DosAndDonts6\"></div>\n\n<p>3. There should be no decimals in the x or y coordinates.</p>\n\n<div data-insert-component=\"DosAndDonts7\"></div>\n\n<p>4. The width and height of the icon should be full pixels (no fractions of pixels).</p>\n\n<div data-insert-component=\"DosAndDonts8\"></div>\n\n<p>5. All strokes and lines are at least 1px, (i.e. 0.75px is not an acceptable stroke thickness).</p>\n\n<div data-insert-component=\"DosAndDonts9\"></div>\n\n<p>6. All strokes and lines are whole pixels (no decimals).</p>\n\n<div data-insert-component=\"DosAndDonts10\"></div>\n\n<p>7. All stokes are expanded or converted to outlines.</p>\n\n<div data-insert-component=\"DosAndDonts11\"></div>\n\n<p>8. All possible layers are merged so there are as few paths as possible.</p>\n\n<div data-insert-component=\"DosAndDonts12\"></div>\n\n<p>9. All layers are ungrouped.</p>\n<p>10. All layers are and artboards are properly named (these names will also be exported and carried over into the code).</p>\n\n#### Pro tips\n\n- Set your workspace up from the start to snap to pixels and round values to whole pixels to avoid correcting shapes later.\n- Never use `center` borders. Centering can cause half pixels.\n- Avoid using the line tool and use the rectangle tool instead. The line tool will place the vector on half pixels.\n- Be aware of automatic alignments which can either place vectors on uneven or half pixels.\n\n### Exporting\n\n#### How to export SVGs from Sketch\n\n1. Draw a 32 x 32 pixel stand-alone artboard.\n2. Place icon in the pixel perfect center of the artboard.\n3. Convert all strokes to outlines `(Shift + ⌘ + O)`.\n4. Select any overlapping shapes and click the `Union` icon from the top navigation, to merge all of the shapes together.\n5. Select the artboard and click `Make Exportable` at the bottom of the right toolbar in Sketch.\n6. In the export widget select `SVG` in the format dropdown.\n7. Click `Export 'Artboard-Name'`.\n8. Name icon with the name of your service. Do not name it or include \"Bluemix icon\" or \"cloud icon\".\n\n#### How to export SVGs from Adobe Illustrator\n\n1. Draw a 32 x 32 pixel stand-alone artboard.\n2. Place icon in the pixel perfect center of the artboard.\n3. Expand all strokes `(Object > Expand)`.\n4. Select all overlapping shapes and click the `Unite` icon in the `Pathfinder` panel, to merge all of the shapes together.\n5. Select `File` from the top navigation bar.\n6. Select `Save A Copy...` which will open a dialog.\n7. On the `Format` dropdown select SVG (svg).\n8. Below `Format` select `Use Artboard` then select either all or a range of artboards depending on your need.\n9. Click `Save`.\n10. The `SVG Options` dialog will then open.\n11. Make sure the preferences are the same as in the image below.\n![export icons from Illustrator](images/service-icon-17.png)\n\n### Optimize icon\nOnce your icon is exported as an SVG you'll need to optimize and clean up the XML code.\n\nRun SVG XML code through [SVGOMG](https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/).\nInspect the code and make sure that your XML doesn't include the following:\n\n- `<g>` tags\n- `class` attribtues\n- `stroke` attributes\n- `stroke-width` attributes\n\n## Icon approval & submission\n\n1. Ensure your icon meets all of the above icon requirements and is pixel perfect.\n2. Submit your icons for review by opening an issue on the [service icons repo](https://github.ibm.com/Bluemix/service-icons) and labeling the issue as \"review needed\".\n3. One of the Carbon team reviewers will review the icon within 3 days of the request, so please plan and allow time to process your approval. If changes are needed, the icon must be resubmitted for approval.\n4. Once the icon has been approved, it can be added to your service broker. Only one icon at 32 x 32 px is needed.\n\n\n## FAQ\n\n**What icon sizes do I need to submit?**\n\nOnly one SVG is required for your service icon. It should be submitted at the dimensions of 32 x 32 px.\n\n**What are you looking for during the approval process?**\n\nWe only check for production quality and do not critique visual styling. The list of `Icon requirements` listed above is what we will be evaluating your icon against.\n\n**I don't understand what you mean by pixel perfect and/or pixel grid and alignment.**\n\nIcon design best practices mandate that all vectors be flush to the base level pixel grid. This means the straight edges of vectors should be aligned with pixels exactly and the points of curves should be aligned whenever possible.\n\nCheck out these [Sketch](https://medium.com/sketch-app-sources/getting-the-pixels-right-in-sketch-2386c730af90) and [Illustrator](http://iconutopia.com/how-to-design-pixel-perfect-icons/) tutorials to learn how to best set up your document and align your icon to the pixel grid. There are also some helpful [Sketch plug-ins](https://github.com/swiadek/pixel-perfecter-sketch-plugin) and [Illustrator tools](https://helpx.adobe.com/illustrator/how-to/pixel-perfect.html) that can do this work for you.\n\n**How do I turn on the pixel grid in Sketch or Illustrator?**\n\nIn Sketch in the top navigation bar select `View` > `Canvas` > `Show Pixel Grid`.\nIn Illustrator, in the top navigation bar select `View` > `Pixel Preview`.\n\n**Why does the icon need to be pixel perfect if its an SVG?**\n\nEven with SVGs, unaligned vectors can cause icons to look fuzzy on low-resolution screens. Unaligned vectors also reflects poorly on the craft of the product and can lessen user trust.\n"

    "content": "**Carbon is committed to following and complying with best practices when it comes to accessibility. Each component and element was built following the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) and met the AA standard. Our patterns are perceivable, operable, and understandable to users, even when using a screen reader or other assistive technology.**\n\n## Keyboard accessibility\nKeyboard accessibility is important for users who rely on or prefer using a keyboard. Encourage accessibility by providing keyboard functionality to all available content. Common keyboard interactions include using the `Tab` key to select different interactive elements on a page and using the `Enter` key or the Spacebar to activate an in-focus element.\n\n### Focus indicators\n\nThe `tab` key navigates through various interactive elements on a page. A default visual indicator is provided by the web browser in use. The display is an outlined border around the focused element. When an element is in focus, it can be further activated using the keyboard.\n\n### Navigation order\n\nThe order in which interactive elements receive focus is logical and predictable. Create the tab flow hierarchy by using the source code to arrange the keyboard navigation. Begin with the header, followed by the main navigation, then page navigation (from left to right, top to bottom), and end with the footer.\n\nUse natively-accessible elements in navigation to activate links, buttons, and form controls with a keyboard. Reinforce semantic HTML to convey intent and meaning instead of simply defining the look and feel of an element. Enhance with ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Application) labels when necessary. For additional customization, use `tabindex=“0”` to ensure a navigable element receives a focus indicator.\n\nProvide a “Skip to content” option when there is lengthy navigation so a user may access main content faster. This option is a link that is visually hidden by default and appears when it receives keyboard focus via the `tab` key.\n\n<a href=\"http://webaim.org/techniques/skipnav/\" target=blank>WebAIM</a> recommends the following to enable a “Skip to content” link.\n\n```html\n<body>\n    <a href=\"#maincontent\">Skip to main content</a>\n    ...\n    <main id=\"maincontent>\n        <h1>Heading</h1>\n        <p>This is the first paragraph</p>\n    </main>\n</body>\n```\n\n\n## Color accessibility\nPlease refer to our [usage](http://carbondesignsystem.com/style/colors/usage) section on the Colors page to learn more about color contrast ratios. You can also use this [color contrast](https://marijohannessen.github.io/color-contrast-checker/) tool to ensure your ratios pass WCAG AA standards. \n"

    "content": "## Voice & Tone\n\nUsing the appropriate voice and tone allows us to better connect and resonate with our users. Gone are the days when our users perceive their content experience as complex, distant, or disjointed. We've evolved and we now endorse a style that should feel like a conversation between friends – personal, relatable, clear, helpful, and engaging. Conversational style does not mean sloppy writing. It means creating content in a clear, concise way that anyone can understand. It means genuinely connecting with our users.\n\nWhat is the difference between voice and tone? Simply put, we have the same voice all the time, but our tone often changes. Consider this: You have one voice, but you most likely use a certain tone when you are having coffee with friends and a different tone when you are meeting with your boss.\n\n> ![voice](images/content-general-1.png)\n\n**Voice** is the foundation for communicating IBM Cloud products and brand message. Our voice expresses the core of our personality, while bringing comfort, ease, and a sense of connection to our users. Our goal is to empower our users to meet their business goals. Be consistent with voice across the platform.\n\n> ![tone](images/content-general-2.png)\n\n**Tone** conveys your attitude toward what you are writing about and who you are writing to. When you create content – whether it's introductory text on the UI, an error message, or a topic in the docs – you are essentially a storyteller. Good storytellers are experts in two main areas: what they are saying (the important information that the audience needs to know) and how to say it (the experience that they want to create for the audience). Be a good storyteller.\n\n## Conversation levels\n\nHere's how conversational you should be based on the six stages of the user journey:\n\n> **MOST: Discover, Try, Buy content**\n\n---\n“Thanks for joining IBM Bluemix for your free 30-day trial. It's been great having you! Unfortunately, your Bluemix trial account, with IBMid name@domain, is now deactivated because your trial is over. While your account is deactivated, you can't access resources. Don't worry, your apps are not deleted.”\n\n> **MORE: Getting started interface content (for example, welcome), interface content for remaining experiences (Productive Use, Manage and Upgrade, Leverage and Extend, Get Support)**\n\n---\n“To start using Bluemix, name your first organization. Think of an org as a project or team that shares resources, such as apps, databases, and other services. Orgs exist in geographic regions, so decide where you'd like to put your first one.”\n\n> **LESS: Instructional content (steps) for how to complete a task**\n\n---\n“Go to Avatar icon > Account > Notifications to set up general account and spending notifications. Spending notifications are available only for Subscription and Pay-As-You-Go Bluemix account owners.”\n"

    "content": "## Capitalization\n\n<img alt=\"capitalization\" src=\"images/Aa.svg\" class=\"content-page__cap-letter\" />\nGood content design is consistent and coherent so that users can trust and predict how to interact with it. Details matter.\n\nAlways capitalize proper names, such as United States. Use ALL CAPS for abbreviations, acronyms, and initials (for example, IBM and ASCII) and two-letter abbreviations (for example, AL, AK, and AZ), and for OK.\n\nFor specific capitalization rules for different element or component types, see the usage details for each individual element or component type.\n\n### Sentence style\n\nUse sentence-style capitalization in text and for all text elements in the UI, except for table/grid column headers, headings for groups of toggles, and product names. Sentence style capitalizes only the first word of each sentence and proper nouns\n(such as names).\n\n**Examples:**\n\n* Cloud Foundry apps\n* Business models\n* Creating Boolean expressions\n* Planning network architectures\n\n### Headline style\n\nUse headline-style capitalization for table/grid column headers and product names. Headline style capitalizes words based on parts of speech.\n\n**Capitalize the initial letter of the following words:**\n\n* All nouns, pronouns, adjectives, verbs, adverbs, and subordinating conjunctions such as:\n* After\n* Although\n* Because\n* Before\n* How\n* If\n* Than\n* That\n* Though\n* Until\n* When\n* Where\n* Whether\n* While\n\n**Do not capitalize the initial letter of the following words:**\n\n* articles, except as the first word\n* coordinating conjunctions\n* prepositions, except as the first or last word\n\n## Do's & Dont's\n\nThese guidelines apply for developers and writers working with IBM Cloud UI and documentation.\n\n---\n***\n### Do use simple tense\n\nUse simple verbs and tenses, and keep sentences concise, simple, friendly, and punchy. Focus on the user's context and make content relevant. The more familiar you are with their context, the better you can communicate without using a lot of words.\n\nIf you need to use past or future tense, avoid verb tenses with the words have, has, had, been, should, would, and will.\n\n\n<div data-insert-component=\"DosAndDonts1\"></div>\n\n---\n***\n### Do use active voice\n\nTo convey a more natural tone, use active voice. People tend to speak in active voice unless they have a reason not to. For example, a good reason to use passive voice is to avoid sounding judgmental or blaming the user. Consider how a statement like, “You entered the wrong value,” which is active voice, might not be a well received error message.\n\n<div data-insert-component=\"DosAndDonts2\"></div>\n\n---\n***\n### Do use second person\n\nEngage your readers by using second person **(you, your)**. First person **(I, we, our)** focuses on the writer rather than the audience. People are interested in what they can do and how your story applies to their lives.\nOne exception to this is in the case of possessive adjectives in the UI. You can use first person in headings or labels that are very specific to the user or customer data, for example “My Account” or “My Usage.” In explanatory text for the heading or label, switch to second person, for example _“Your usage is calculated from the 1st day of the month.”_\n\n---\n***\n### Don't be too formal or stuffy\n\n* Do not be afraid to use contractions once in a while. Decide whether they fit the context.\n* Occasionally begin sentences with **and, but or so.** This usage allows for shorter, scannable sentences. Do not overuse these devices, especially in instructional (steps) content.\n* For example, _“You can deploy an app to the cloud during lunch hour. And still have time to eat”_ is great for Discover, Try, Buy.\n* Occasionally use questions in headings. In both UIs and documentation, questions can be used to further conversational style, but don't overuse them, as they can add to noise and hinder retrievability. Make sure headings that use questions are meaningful. In a UI, questions can be used in a confirmation prompt in a dialog box. For example: _“Do you want to close without saving?”_\n* Use exclamation marks only positively, not negatively. Make sure you use no more than one exclamation mark in a context, such as a single window or a single Docs topic.\n\n<div data-insert-component=\"DosAndDonts3\"></div>\n\n---\n***\n### Don't be overly mannerly\n\nTerms of politeness are superfluous, convey the wrong tone for technical material, and are not regarded the same way in all cultures.\n\nUse **please** in a UI only when the user is being inconvenienced.\n\n<div data-insert-component=\"DosAndDonts4\"></div>\n"

We welcome all feedback, designs, or ideas in order to produce the best possible experience for our users.**\n\nThe guidelines below are primarily for **design contributions**. You can also read our guidelines for [contributing code](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-components/blob/master/docs/contributing.md). If you have any questions, reach out to us at carbon@us.ibm.com.\n<br> <br>\n\n## Contribution model & process\n### 1. Submit an issue\nThe easiest way for us to get an understanding of your needs is to open an issue. Follow our issue template (you'll see this when you go to open a new issue) to ensure you are meeting the issue writing requirements. Screenshots are required when submitting a new pattern or component. A member of the Carbon team will respond to your issue with next steps or a follow up.\n\n**Not sure where to open an issue?**\n\nThe [carbon-design-kit repo](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-design-kit) is for Sketch bugs, as well as feedback on the Design Kit and component design.\n\nThe [design-system-website repo](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/design-system-website) is for Carbon website specific feedback or bugs.\n\n**Not sure how to submit an issue?**\n\nIt's not so bad, we promise! You can read a [tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-issue/) on GitHub to get familiar with best practices.\n\n### 2. Design review and sync\nThe easiest way to move forward in the design process is to set up an in-person or remote call with the Carbon team to go over your design work. We'll provide you with feedback on your proposal and what, if any, changes are needed before bringing them into Carbon.\n\n_Please make sure you have run through these design guidelines prior to the initial design review meeting. The Carbon team will be looking for a few major things:_\n\n\n#### Accessible\n\n* Is your design [WCAG AA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/) accessible?\n* Does your design pass [color contrast](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/visual-audio-contrast-contrast.html) ratio?\n* Have you considered [keyboard tabbing](http://carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/accessibility) and focus states?\n\n\n#### Componentized\nMost components we accept into the global library need to work universally across products.\n\n* Have you tested this design for multiple use cases? It needs to be a pattern that all teams can utilize, and global enough to fit use cases for other teams.\n* Is there a similar component in the library that already exists?\n* What are the advantages of this pattern over alternative patterns?\n\n\n\n#### Visual style and UX patterns\n\n* Is your design consistent with our default visual style we have established for the core Carbon library?\n* Do your interaction patterns (hover, focus, motion) match Carbon styles?\n* Does your design follow basic UX best practices?\n* Does your design promote clear language, correct grammar, and support globalization?\n\n<hr>\n\n\n### 3. Roadmap\nWe'll work with your team to determine when your design will be implemented into Carbon, and the logisitics behind it. Development resources are greatly appreciated and welcomed. If your pattern is submitted without any code, please keep in mind it may be delayed from getting released into the Carbon component library until we can fit it into our team sprint schedule.\n"

To design for great user experiences, you must understand how they are put together and why they can touch people at a deeper level.**\n\n## Be essential\n\nEvery element in an experience should have a purpose. Leaving complexity behind allows you to design with restraint by emphasizing the essential and stripping away the distracting. Provide all the necessary information in a sleek and elegant way, so we can be distinct, clear, and concise with our users.\n![be essential](images/overview-1.png)\n\n## Be inclusive\n\nGood design should work for everyone. We need not to focus only on the average person, with regular needs and expectations. Keep in mind that the people using your products will be extremely diverse. User diversity covers variation in capabilities, needs, and aspirations. Empathize with a full spectrum of potential users instead of designing around a checklist.\n![be inclusive](images/overview-2.png)\n\n## Be consistent\n\nConsistency is not exact replication. Rather, it's a harmonious uniformity, instilling predictability and stability. A successful design should leave our users feeling like, “Yes, that makes sense.” Being consistent gives users the power to anticipate what will happen next. And when users encounter something that is expected, it creates a sense of comfort and trust. Usability is greatly improved when an experience acts and feels the same throughout.\n![be consistent](images/overview-3.png)\n\n## Be humanistic\n\nMore than being user-centered, we must be human-centered. Our designs are conceived from a deep understanding of the people behind the product and with the desire to help individuals accomplish their goals. Part of being humanistic is embracing empathy. Empathy is the ability to understand and share another personʼs perspective, feelings, and challenges. Go out of your way to identify with your user's needs.\n![be humanistic](images/overview-4.png)\n\n## Be delightful\n\nEnhances usability and delight by embracing the spirit of “just enough design”. Engaging users with inspiration and curiosity by designing experiences to encourage critical thinking and creative confidence. Be mindful of usersʼ needs by providing them with the right tools at the right time. Make an offering so effective that it doesn't simply read as a software or a product but as something useful in that person's life.\n![be delightful](images/overview-5.png)\n"

Color should always be used in meaningful and intentional ways in order to create patterns and visual cues.**\n\n## Color palette\n\nThe Carbon color palette is designed and implemented in a themable manner. The universal color variables are determined by common roles and usage; it is not based singularly on a color value (i.e. unique hex code). The same color value may be assigned to multiple variables in a theme's palette when the values have distinctly different roles.\n\nA universal variable can also have multiple associated roles when the color is consistently used across those roles.

    "content": "**The _CSS grid structure_ utilizes a flexbox-based layout to enable developers to quickly craft layout. Use of our grid classes is not required, but is there to help align and speed the development process with the design specifications of the grid. The grid system is loosely based around the semantics of the Bootstrap grid, so if you're familiar with the technicalities of that grid, this should feel similar.**\n\n## Basic Usage\n\n```html\n<div class=\"bx--grid\">\n\u000e\u000e\u000e  <div class=\"bx--row\">\n    <div class=\"bx--col-xs-12 \">\n      <p>Content space for bx--col-xs-12 bx--col-sm-6</p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n```\n\nLet's run through the grid, there are a few fundamental building blocks that make up our layout.\n\n#### `bx--grid`\n\nThe `bx--grid` creates the wrapper container to space your overall page according to design. This is meant to wrap your highest level content, typically used at `main` element below the Common Header.\n\n#### `bx--row`\n\nThe `bx--row` initializes the element as a `display: flex` parent item, and is used as a wrapper element for any subsequent `bx--col-*` child elements. `bx--row` assumes child `bx--col` classes and applies a negative margin, it is not advised to use `bx--row` as a standalone wrapper.\n\n#### `bx--col`\n\nThe `bx--col-{breakpoint}-{columnNumber}` is our mobile-first look at creating layouts. There are six major breakpoints\n\n| Breakpoint Name | Media Query |\n|-----------------|-------------|\n| `xs`            | 0 - 576px   |\n| `sm`            | > 576px     |\n| `md`            | > 768px     |\n| `lg`            | > 992px     |\n| `xl`            | > 1200px    |\n| `xxl`           | > 1600px    |\n\n`bx--col-xs-{columnNumber}` is the grid layout that responds to mobile - all layouts should at th every least contain a `bx--col-xs-{columnNumber}` class on them. Any additional class is stacked on top of the original; at that breakpoint, the layout will adopt that number of columns.\n\nSo an application layout that had two blocks of content that were each full width at mobile, but then at a medium breakpoint (approximately tablet) became two columns would look like this\n\n```html\n<div class=\"bx--grid\">\n  <div class=\"bx--row\">\n    <div class=\"bx--col-xs-12 bx--col-md-6\">Some content here</div>\n    <div class=\"bx--col-xs-12 bx--col-md-6\">Some content here</div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n```\n\n\n#### bx--col-{breakpoint}-auto\n\nInstead of requiring a certain number of columns for an element to take up, you can also specify the auto class in lieu of a column number. This will tell the column to take as much room as the width of that column's content requires.\n\n**Important:** All `bx--col` elements must be the direct child of a `bx--row` element.\n"

    "content": "**_Grid_ systems are used for creating page layouts through a series of rows and columns that house your content. Carbon uses a responsive, mobile first, fluid grid system that appropriately scales up to 12 columns as the device or viewport size increases.**\n\n## Basic structure\n\n<div data-insert-component=\"GridExample\"></div>\n\n### Grid with a side panel\n\nA left or right side panel lives outside the bounds of the grid, including the grid margins. When a side panel appears it pushes the grid away from the outer edge of the browser window condensing the grid and content area.\n\nFor example, when using an [Interior Left Nav](http://carbondesignsystem.com/add-ons/interior-left-nav/code), the grid starts after the 200px of the navigation on the left side of the viewport. Normal grid rules still apply within the content area.\n\n**Grid area with interior left navigation: page width minus 200px from left edge.**\n_\n![Interior left nav grid](images/grid-4.png)\n_\n\n## How it works\n\n### Gutters\n\nColumns create gutters (gaps between column content) through padding. For devices with a screen width greater than 768px, the column padding is 20px. For devices with a screen width less than 768px, the column padding is 10px.\n\n**Screen width ≥ 768px = 20px gutters**\n\n**Screen width < 768px = 10px gutters**\n\n### Columns\n\nCarbon designs should be limited to twelve columns. If designers feel that they need fewer columns in their grid, they can specify the number of twelve available columns they wish to span.\n\nThis can translate to percentages of the twelve columns. Using this method, a designer can create a folded, less granular grid. For example, if your component spans three equal columns, that is equal to 25% of twelve columns.\n\n**Column count: 12**\n_\n![Interior left nav grid](images/grid-5.png)\n_\n_@1440px - 12 Columns / 20px Gutters / 5% Margins_\n\n### Margins\n\nThe twelve column grid does not have a maximum width. It has a width of 100%, with built in margins that create padding between column count and the edges of the viewport.\n\nIn devices with a screen width greater than 768px, the margins are 5% on the left, and 5% on the right.\n\n**Example: Screen Width 768px**\n\n* 5% left = 38px (rounded to nearest whole pixel)\n* 5% right = 38px (rounded to nearest whole pixel)\n* 12 columns + gutters = 768px - 38px - 38px = 692px (rounded to nearest whole pixel)\n\nIn devices with a screen width less than 768px, the margins are 3% on the left, and 3% on the right.\n\n**Example: Screen Width 320px**\n\n* 3% left = 10px (rounded to nearest whole pixel)\n* 3% right = 10px (rounded to nearest whole pixel)\n* 12 columns + gutters = 320px - 10px - 10px = 300px (rounded to nearest whole pixel)\n\n### Breakpoints\n\n---\n\n| Size        | Columns | Gutters            | Outer margins     |\n| ----------- | ------- | ------------------ | ----------------- |\n| XS (576px)  | 12      | 5px + 5px = 10px   | 3% left, 3% right |\n| S (768px)   | 12      | 10px + 10px = 20px | 5% left, 5% right |\n| M (992px)   | 12      | 10px + 10px = 20px | 5% left, 5% right |\n| L (1200px)  | 12      | 10px + 10px = 20px | 5% left, 5% right |\n| XL (1600px) | 12      | 10px + 10px = 20px | 5% left, 5% right |\n\n## Large scale grid\n\nCarbon allows for two types of large scale grids. The type of grid used should be based on content type and density. The large scale grid should be consistent within individual sections of the product. For example, all Configuration pages within Bluemix should have either a max width or grow exponentially. The choice of this grid belongs to the teams that own each section/template.\n\n### Option 1: Exponential grid (default)\n\nThe width of the grid and content area grows exponentially and the margin always remain at 5%. The width of each column continuiously grows and gutters remain at 20px.\n\n_\n![Expontential large scale grid](images/grid-6.png)\n_\n_@2560px - 12 Columns exponetial grid / 20px Gutters / 5% Margins_\n\n### Option 2: Max width\n\nThe max width is 1600px, with the margins growing exponentially past that point. Content and columns are centered on page and the margins grow equally on left and right of content.\n\nIf a side panel exists with a max width layout, then the panel should stick to the edges of the viewport with the exponential margin between the grid columns and the panel. This is not an ideal usecase.\n\n_\n![Max width large scale grid](images/grid-7.png)\n_\n_@2560px - 12 Columns at max width 1600px / 20px Gutters / Exponential Margins_\n"

    "content": "## Adding icons\nIf you would like to add an UI icon to our library, please submit a pull request in the Carbon Design Kit <a href=\"https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-design-kit\" target=blank>GitHub repo.</a>\n\n**If you're not comfortable with making a Pull Request, please submit an issue in the repo with the icon attached.**\n\n1. Correctly export icon\n2. Name icon to Carbon specifications\n3. Prep SVG XML code\n4. Submit icon to [carbon-icons](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-icons) repo\n5. Test SVGs\n\n\n## Exporting SVGs\n### Best practices\n* **Square icons:** create an artboard for an individual icon that is 24 x 24 pixels (or 16 x 16 pixels for glyphs)\n* **Rectangular icons:** make sure the width or the height of the artboard is 24 pixels (16 pixels for glyphs).\n* Each artboard and the artwork within it must be aligned to the pixel grid.\n* Icons should be at whole pixels. No decimals in x and y coordinates or width and height fields.\n* All strokes must be expanded.\n* All strokes must be full pixels.\n* No padding when exporting icons (internal and external padding can be added with CSS).\n* Combine all possible shapes and paths.\n* Ungroup icon layers completely. It should be on the top-most layer in your artboard.\n* Make sure to properly name layers and artboards (these names will also be exported into the code).\n\n### How to export SVGs from Sketch\n1. Draw an artboard that is the same size as your icon (at least one side should be 24px or 16px exactly). The artboard should hug the edges of the icon.\n2. Place the icon squarely on the artboard making sure its aligned to the pixel grid.\n3. Convert all strokes to outlines `(Shift + ⌘ + O)`\n4. Select any overlapping shapes and click the Union icon from the top navigation, to merge all of the shapes together.\n5. Make sure the icon is at `#000000` and has no additional styling.\n6. Select the entire artboard (not just the icon).\n7. Click `Make Exportable` at the bottom of the right toolbar in Sketch.\n8. In the `Export` widget select SVG in the format dropdown.\n9. Click `Export 'Artboard-Name'`.\n10. Name icon with the `#name--modifier` convention. (ex. copy.svg, copy--glyph.svg, add.svg, add--glyph.svg).\n\n<div data-insert-component=\"Video\" data-props=\"icon-sketch.mp4\"></div>\n\n### How to export SVGs from Adobe Illustrator\n1. Draw an artboard that is the same size as your icon (at least one side should be 24px or 16px exactly). The artboard should hug the edges of the icon.\n2. Place the icon squarely on the artboard making sure its aligned to the pixel grid.\n3. Expand all strokes `(Object > Expand)`.\n4. Select all overlapping shapes and click the Unite icon in the Pathfinder panel, to merge all of the shapes together.\n5. Make sure the icon is at `#000000` and has no additional styling.\n6. Select `“File”` from the top navigation.\n7. Select `Save A Copy...` which will open a dialog.\n8. On the `Format` dropdown select SVG (svg).\n9. Below `Format` select `Use Artboard` then select either all or a range of artboards depending on your need.\n10. Click `Save`.\n11. The `SVG Options` dialog will then open.\n12. Make sure the preferences are the same as in the image below.\n\n\n![export an icon from illustrator](images/icon-contribution-3.png)\n\n<div data-insert-component=\"Video\" data-props=\"icon-illustrator.mp4\"></div>\n\n## Developer guidelines\n\n### Naming SVG files\n\nWe use the following naming convention for SVG filenames:\n\n* `name`: icon name (ex. `add.svg`)\n* `name--outline`: icon with an outline (ex. `add--outline.svg`)\n* `name--glyph`: icon that is a glyph (ex. `add--glyph`)\n* `name--new`: new icon that replaces a deprecated icon\n\n### Prepping SVG XML code\n\nIt's the goal of this library to make sure icons can be modified with CSS to change it's __color__ (`fill`) and __size__ (`width`, `height`).  \n\nRun SVG XML code through <a href=\"https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/\" target=blank>SVGOMG</a>\nInspect the code and make sure that your XML doesn't include the following:\n\n- `<style>` tags\n- `<g>` tags\n- `class` attributes\n- `stroke` attributes\n- `stroke-width` attributes\n\n### Submitting new SVGs\n\n1. Fork the <a href=\"https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-icons\" target=blank>carbon-icons</a> repo.\n2. Close the fork.\n3. Add new SVG file(s) to <a href=\"https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-icons/tree/master/svg\" target=blank>svg</a> folder. SVG subfolders are deprecated as of version `3.0.0`.\n4. Submit a pull request\n5. Do not commit built files (files created from `npm run build` script).\n\n### Testing SVGs\n\n1. `npm run build` to build new SVG sprite files.\n2. `npm test` to run unit tests\n3. `npm start` and go to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/), make sure added icons are rendering correctly\n4. Optional: Go to [localhost:3000/test](http://localhost:3000/test) and test styling of icon manually using CSS.\n\nUnit tests are run against built SVG sprite files (carbon-icons.svg and sprite.svg).\nDo not commit built files to pull requests.\n"

    "section": "usage",
    "content": "**_Iconography_ uses images and symbols to represent an object visually. They communicate a message and should be distinct and informative. Icons should be used sparingly throughout the product to provide clarity and reduce cognitive load on users.**\n\n## Resources\n\nYou can find the source file for the icon library within the <a href=\"https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-design-kit\" target=blank>Carbon Design Kit.</a>\n\n- <a href=\"https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-icons\" target=blank>Carbon icons GitHub repo</a>\n- <a href=\"http://www.ibm.com/design/language/resources/icon-library/\" target=blank>IBM Design Language icon library</a>\n\n## Visual usage\n\n### Sizing\n\nUI icons come in two sizes: 24px and 16px.\nWhile most icons occupy a square artboard, some icons may occupy a rectangular artboard where the width or height of the icons is either 24px or 16px. In most cases, you can use icons at their original sizes.\n\n| Name     | px |\n|----------|----|\n| Standard | 24 |\n| Glyph    | 16 |\n\n### Background\n\nAll icons should be on a transparent background and with the artboard boundaries at the edges of the icon. At least one of the edges should be at the standard measurement of 24px or 16px.\n\n---\n![icon usage](images/icon-usage-1.png)\n\n### Padding\n\nWhen **creating icons,** do not add internal padding with Sketch or Illustrator. If the icon needs padding, developers can add this with CSS.\n\nWhen **using icons,** all touch targets need to be 44px or higher. With that said, a developer can add padding to a touch target with CSS to meet the 44px requirement.\n\n---\n![icon padding](images/icon-usage-2.png)\n\n### Color\n\nInteractive UI icons need to pass the same color contrast ratio as typography at a 4.5:1 ratio. UI icons are always a solid color. The color of the icon should depend on the importance of the icon's action.\n\n|                        | SCSS      | HEX     |\n|------------------------|-----------|---------|\n| Primary action         | $brand-01 | #3d70b2 |\n| Primary action:hover   | $brand-02 | #5596e6 |\n| Secondary action       | $ui-05    | #8c9ba5 |\n| Secondary action:hover | $brand-01 | #3d70b2 |\n\n**Exception:** There is an exception to both the `brand-01` and UI color rules. Certain icons, such as status or notification icons, can inherit their parent color. For example, a warning icon is yellow because warning notifications are yellow.\n\n### Weight\n\nIcons of the same size should have the same visual weight. One icon should not look heavier or lighter than another icon of the same size. Most UI Icons are drawn with a two pixel stroke.\n\nMake sure the 2px stroke does not change when resizing icons because it causes\nicons to look uneven. When scaling icons you should always start each icon at the same base size (preferably the default of 24px).\n\nGlyphs or 16 pixel icons, should always be a filled icon. This adds visual weight to the icon, allowing it to maintain its proper emphasis and stay legible. Fine stroke weights can disappear or break at the glyph size.\n\n### Pixel grid\n\nWhen drawing or re-sizing icons make sure the vector always aligns to the base pixel grid. This ensures pixel clarity and crispness on all screen ratios. The x and y coordinates of icons should never contain decimals.\n\n## Developer usage\n\n### Using SVG sprite (recommended)\n\n**Requirements:**\n\n- Install `carbon-icons`\n\nFull installation details in <a href=\"https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-icons\">Carbon icons GitHub repo.</a>\n\n### Using SVG sprite from static assets (recommended)\n\nUse the SVG sprite (__carbon-icons.svg__) by serving it as a static asset.\nThen reference the SVG icon you want to display using a path to the SVG sprite file.\nTo use SVG sprite files, they __must__ be distributed through a web server and while using `svgxuse`.\n\n```html\n<!-- From static assets  -->\n<svg>\n  <use xlink:href=\"/path_to_static-assets/carbon-icons.svg#icon_name\"></use>\n</svg>\n```\n\n`path_to_static-assets` is the path to your static assets where `carbon-icons.svg` is located.\n\n`icon_name` is the icon name, which will display the corresponding icon. Refer to the <a href=\"http://carbondesignsystem.com/style/iconography\" target=blank>iconography library</a> page for a full list of icon names.\n\n### CSS\n\nYou can override size and color with CSS.\n\n```html\n<svg class=\"icon\">\n  <use xlink:href=\"/path_to_static-assets/carbon-icons.svg#icon_name\"></use>\n</svg>\n```\n\n```css\n.icon {\n  width: 24px;\n  height: 24px;\n  fill: red;\n}\n```\n\nAll icons in the library are standardized so that they do not include `stroke` or internal spacing (`padding`).\n\n### Inline SVG\n\nIf you're unable to use the recommended SVG sprite or `svgxuse`, you can inline SVG directly into your HTML.\n\nVisit carbon-icons and browse the svg folder for any icons you want to use. (Remember, svg subfolders contain deprecated icons. Don't use these).\n\n### Main files\n\nCarbon icons ship with two main SVG files that contain different sets of external SVG sprite files:\n\n---\n| Filename | Description | Supported versions|\n|-----|--------|---------------|\n|carbon-icons.svg| Contains current icons (consolidated subset of legacy icons used in IBM Bluemix) | `3.x` and newer|\n|carbon-icons.json| JSON file created from carbon-icons.svg, used in [Carbon](http://carbondesignsystem.com/style/iconography/library) | `3.x` and newer|\n|carbon-icons.js| JS module created from carbon-icons.svg, used in `Icon` React Component in [carbon-components-react](#) | `3.x` and newer|\n|sprite.svg| SVG sprite contains legacy icons | `1.x`, `2.x` and `3.x`|\n|icons.json| legacy JSON file created from sprite.svg | `1.x`, `2.x` and `3.x`|\n|legacy-icons.js| JS module created from sprite.svg | `3.x` only|\n\n### Accessibility\n\nFor screen reader accessibility, provide a context-rich title for the SVG using `<title>` element.\n\n```html\n<svg>\n  <title>Add a new service</title>\n  <use xlink:href=\"/carbon-icons/dist/icon--add--glyph\"></use>\n</svg>\n```\n\nIf support for older browsers is needed, use `aria-labelledby` attribute to reference the `<title>` element using an `id`.\nThe `<title>` element will be read by the screen reader to the user so it should describe its purpose.\nMake sure that you do not duplicate this `id`.\n\n```html\n<svg aria-labelledby=\"add\">\n  <title id=\"add\">Add a new service</title>\n  <use xlink:href=\"/carbon-icons/dist/icon--add--glyph\"></use>\n</svg>\n```\n\nFor more details on accessibility, see the following resources:\n- \"Accessible SVGs\" via [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/accessible-svgs/)\n- \"5.4 The 'desc' and 'title' elements\" via [W3C.org](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/struct.html#DescriptionAndTitleElements)\n"

The layer container can be styled as needed.\n\n### Content on layer\n\n- Content appears on same plane as layer, content does not add to a layer's elevation.\n- Content on a layer is bound by the edges of the layer container. Content cannot cross boundaries of the layer.\n- Borders are the only overarching limitation of the content on layer, however limitations on the content per component may occur. See individual components for more details.\n\n## Elevation\n\nEach type of layer lives on a different imagined plane of the UI giving each its own distinct elevation. Elevation is the implied measured distance above the base layer. The affect of the elevation on a layer is defined by the intensity and depth of the shadow it casts.\n\n### Elevation scale\n\nThe range of imagined planes in the UI are on a scale from 0 to 24, with zero being the base and 24 the highest point. The higher the elevation is the larger the shadow each layer will cast. Each unit on the elevation scale is equal to the pixel value of the coded blur applied to shadow.\n\nEach layer is a defined marker along the elevation scale.

    "content": "## Principles\n\nMotion brings personality, tone, rhythm, and purpose to otherwise static objects. When used properly, UI motion should feel like a well choreographed dance, with all of the elements acting and reacting to one another in sync. Start with a clear objective, layering in movements that mimic reality and guide the user through an interface.\n\n### Purposeful\n\nMotion within an experience should be meaningful and intentional. It is used to establish hierarchy and draw the user’s attention to essential elements, giving them an understanding of an object’s role within the design. In order to convey this, the motion needs to be quick, direct, and precise.\n\n### Familiar\n\nMotion design should mirror movements we encounter in the physical world around us. Mimicking the expected behavior of objects from reality creates repetition and consistency, which enables users to anticipate what comes next. Providing motion feedback can help guide the user’s workflow, creating a clear path towards their end goal.\n\n### Unobtrusive\n\nMotion should be used with discretion—a little bit goes a long way. When applied properly, motion goes unnoticed. If a motion feels like it is calling attention to itself, tone it down! Subtlety ensures that the user won’t be distracted and allows for a cohesive motion experience across components.\n\n## Guidelines\n\n### Duration\n\nMovement should be slow enough that the user can recognize what's happening, but fast enough that they are never waiting. The magnitude of change in an animation and its importance combine to determine its duration. Most animations in our component library last between 100 and 300 milliseconds.\n\n<div data-insert-component=\"MotionExample\" data-props=\"duration,300ms,600ms\"></div>\n\n| Type                     | Duration  |\n|--------------------------|-----------|\n| Buttons/small components | 100-200ms |\n| Alerts/table reorder     | 250-300ms |\n| Panels/modals            | 300-400ms |\n| Page transitions         | 500-700ms |\n\n### Easing\n\nStrictly linear movement appears strange to the human eye. An animation should accelerate and decelerate smoothly throughout its duration to appear as natural as possible.\n\n<div data-insert-component=\"MotionExample\" data-props=\"easing,Easing,No-Easing\"></div>\n\nThere are three specific easing curves: standard, ease-out, and ease-in.\n\nYou can think of “in” and “out” as referring to the side of the curve where more time will be spent. So an ease-out will slow down into it's final position. More time is dedicated to the end of the curve or the \"out\".\n\n**Standard:** cubic-bezier(0.5, 0, 0.1, 1)\nThe standard cubic-bezier is used for the majority of animations. Especially when extra context is needed or when an element is removed from the screen but easily accessible (i.e. slide out navigation panel). Acceleration and deceleration occur asymmetrically to feel natural. This means that more emphasis is placed on the end of the curve than at the beginning. In most cases, a user will need greater easing at the end of a movement to allow their eye to register the new state of the element.\n\n<div data-insert-component=\"MotionExample\" data-props=\"standard\"></div>\n\n**Ease-out:** cubic-bezier(0, 0, 0.25, 1)\nThe ease-out cubic-bezier is used for adding elements to the stage or changing on-screen states at a users' input.\nEase-out is a much more dramatic curve because it is used for moving elements onto the stage. In which case, the object will slowly come to rest allowing the user to adjust to its arrival.\n\n<div data-insert-component=\"MotionExample\" data-props=\"ease-out\"></div>\n\n**Ease-in:** cubic-bezier(0.25, 0, 1, 1)\nThe ease-in cubic-bezier is used primarily for removing elements from the screen or stage.\nEase-in does not need as much easing since it is primarily used for objects exiting the stage. Therefore, slow it slightly to allow the user to recognize that it is exiting before speeds out of view.\n\n<div data-insert-component=\"MotionExample\" data-props=\"ease-in\"></div>\n\n### Properties\n\nThe reality of the web is that <a href=\"https://csstriggers.com/\" target=blank>some properties</a> are better to animate than others since some properties trigger more work for the browser than others. With a few exceptions, animations should be created by making changes to the transform and opacity properties.\n"

    "content": "**_Typography_ is used to create clear hierarchies, useful organizations, and purposeful alignments that guide users through the product and experience. It is the core structure of any well designed interface.**\n\n## Typeface: IBM Plex\n\nCarbon uses the new IBM open-sourced typeface, IBM Plex. It has been carefully designed to meet IBM's needs as a global technology company and reflect IBM's spirit, beliefs and design principles. IBM Plex can be accessed and downloaded from the <a href=\"https://github.com/ibm/type\" target=\"blank\">IBM GitHub repo</a>.\n\nTo use IBM Plex with Carbon components, simply toggle the scss variable `$css--plex` to true and components will automatically update.\n\n```scss\n$css--plex: true;\n```\n\n#### Sans-serif font stack\n\n```scss\nfont-family: 'ibm-plex-sans', 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, sans-serif;\n```\n\n#### Monospaced font stack\n\n```scss\nfont-family: 'ibm-plex-mono', 'Menlo', 'DejaVu Sans Mono', 'Bitstream Vera Sans Mono', Courier;\n```\n\n## Type scale\n\n<div data-insert-component=\"TypographyTable\"></div>\n\n### How it works\n\nIBM designed a complementary type scale to use with IBM Plex. Each step on the scale is determined by the previous step on the scale. Mathematically it works out to the following:\n\n```markup\nX₂=X₁+{INT[(n-2)/4]+1}x2\n\nX : step n type size     X₁ : step n-1 type size\n```\n\nThe gap between two steps is always based on increments of two. It is a non-linear arithmetic progression, providing a smaller interval for smaller type and a larger interval for larger type, allowing for a wide range of scales. It provides sensible value and works well in a product environments.\n\n## Typographic treatments\n\n### Font weight\n\nFont weight is an important typographic style that can add emphasis and is used to differentiate content hierarchy. Font weight and size pairings must be carefully balanced. A bold weight will always have more emphasis than a lighter weight font of the same size. However, a lighter weight font can rank hierarchically higher than a bold font if the lighter weight type size is significantly larger than the bold.\n\nIBM Plex family provides a wide range of weights. However, only SemiBold, Regular, Light should be used for product design.\n\n---\n***\n|  |  |\n|--------------|------------|\n| Font-weight: 300 / Light <br> _Should only be used at sizes greater than or equal to 18px / 1.125rem_  | Light 300  |\n| Font-weight: 400 / Normal | Normal 400 |\n| Font-weight: 600 / Semi-bold   | Semi-bold 600   |\n\n### Body copy\n\nWe recommend using two sizes for body copy. The first is UI specific. To maximize screen real estate we chose a smaller 14px / 0.875rem body copy size for the standard UI console. However, for areas that have prolonged reading, like Documentation, we use a larger body copy size of 16px / 1rem to enhance readability.\n\n|Body copy         | px   | rem     |\n|------------------|-----|--------|\n|Standard UI       |14px |0.875rem|\n|Prolonged reading |16px |1rem    |\n\n### Line-height\n\nLine-height, traditionally known as leading, is one of several factors that directly contribute to readability and pacing of copy. Line-heights are based on the size of the font itself. Ideal line-heights for standard copy have a ratio of 1:1.5 (typesize : line-height). For example, a type at 16px/1rem would have a line-height of 1.5rem/24px (16 x 1.5). The exception to this rule are headings, which need less spacing and therefore have a line-height ratio of 1:1.25.\n\n|Line-height       |Ratio  |\n|------------------|-------|\n|Standard UI       |1:1.5  |\n|Headers           |1:1.25 |\n\n\n### Line-length\n\nLine-length, traditionally known as measure, is the number of characters in a single line. It also directly contributes to the readability and pacing of copy. Lines that are too long degrade eye tracking from line to line, making it difficult to gauge which line to read next. In contrast, lines that are too short make it difficult for a reader to maintain a steady reading rhythm. Short lines often create disproportionate ragged edges that negatively affect the design.\n\n**Line-length: 52 - 78 characters**\n"

    "content": "## Carbon type styles\n\nCarbon uses a double-stranded heading hierarchy which abstracts the HTML document hierarchy (`h1`, `h2`, etc.) from the visual hierarchy of the layout. This layer of abstraction is important to maintaining the document outline of a page for tools like screen readers. In Carbon, this abstracted layer is known as type styles. Each type style has an assigned CSS classname. These classes are independent of location or type of element.\n\nType styles are simply pre-set configurations of typographic elements (font-size, weight, line-height, etc) and are most commonly used as headers. Selecting the appropriate type style is determined by layout or template structure. Products may have several levels of architecture or areas that require varying typographic hierarchies.\n\nTo use a type style insert the `.bx--type-x` classname associated with each style (ie `.bx--type-alpha`).\n\n<div data-insert-component=\"TypeStylesTable\"></div>\n\n"

    "content": "**_Typography_ is used to create clear hierarchies, useful organizations, and purposeful alignments that guide users through the product and experience. It is the core structure of any well designed interface.**\n\n## Typeface: IBM Plex\n\nCarbon uses the new IBM open-sourced typeface, IBM Plex. It has been carefully designed to meet IBM's needs as a global technology company and reflect IBM's spirit, beliefs and design principles. IBM Plex can be accessed and downloaded from the <a href=\"https://github.com/ibm/type\" target=\"blank\">IBM Github repo</a>.\n\nTo use IBM Plex with Carbon components, simply toggle the scss variable `$css--plex` to true and components will automatically update.\n\n```scss\n$css--plex: true;\n```\n\n**Sans-serif font stack**\n\n```scss\nfont-family: 'ibm-plex-sans', 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, sans-serif;\n```\n\n**Monospaced font stack**\n\n```scss\nfont-family: 'ibm-plex-mono', 'Menlo', 'DejaVu Sans Mono', 'Bitstream Vera Sans Mono', Courier;\n```\n\n## Type scale\n\n<div data-insert-component=\"TypographyTable\"></div>\n\n### How it works\n\nIBM designed a complementary type scale to use with IBM Plex. Each step on the scale is determined by the previous step on the scale. Mathematically it works out to the following:\n\n```\nX₂=X₁+{INT[(n-2)/4]+1}x2\n\nX : step n type size     X₁ : step n-1 type size\n```\n\nThe gap between two steps is always based on increments of 2. It is a non-linear arithmetic progression, providing a smaller interval for smaller type and a larger interval for larger type, allowing for a wide range of scales. It provides sensible value and works well in a product environments.\n\n## Typographic treatments\n\n### Font weight\n\nFont weight is an important typographic style that can add emphasis and is used to differentiate content hierarchy. Font weight and size pairings must be carefully balanced. A bold weight will always have more emphasis than a lighter weight font of the same size. However, a lighter weight font can rank hierarchically higher than a bold font if the lighter weight type size is significantly larger than the bold.\n\nIBM Plex family provides a wide range of weights. However, only SemiBold, Regular, Light should be used for product design.\n\n---\n***\n|  |  |\n|--------------|------------|\n| Font-weight: 300 / Light <br> _Should only be used at sizes greater than or equal to 18px / 1.125rem_  | Light 300  |\n| Font-weight: 400 / Normal | Normal 400 |\n| Font-weight: 600 / Semi-bold   | Semi-bold 600   |\n\n### Body copy\n\nWe recommend using two sizes for body copy. The first is UI specific. To maximize screen real estate we chose a smaller 14px / 0.875rem body copy size for the standard UI console. However, for areas that have prolonged reading, like Documentation, we use a larger body copy size of 16px / 1rem to enhance readability.\n\n## Body copy\n\n### Font size\n\nWe recommend using two sizes for body copy. The first is UI specific. Due to valuable screen real estate we chose a smaller 14px / 0.875rem body copy size for the standard UI console. However, for areas that have prolonged reading, like Documentation, we use a larger body copy size of 16px / 1rem to enhance readability.\n\n**Standard Console: 14px / 0.875rem**\n\n**Prolonged reading: 16px / 1rem**\n\n### Line-height\n\nLine-height, traditionally known as leading, is one of several factors that directly contribute to readability and pacing of copy. Line-heights are based on the size of the font itself. Ideal line-heights for standard copy have a ratio of 1.5. For example, a type at 1em/16px would have a line-height of 24px (16 x 1.5). The exception to this rule are headings, which need less spacing and therefore have a line-height ratio of 1.25.\n\n**Standard line-height: type size x 1.5**\n\n**Headings line-height: type size x 1.25**\n\n### Line-length\n\nLine-length, traditionally known as measure, is the number of characters in a single line. It also directly contributes to the readability and pacing of copy. Lines that are too long degrade eye tracking from line to line, making it difficult to gauge which line to read next. In contrast, lines that are too short make it difficult for a reader to maintain a steady reading rhythm. Short lines often create disproportionate ragged edges that negatively affect the design.\n\n**Line-length: 52 - 78 characters**\n\n## Custom styling\n\n### Letter-spacing\n\nCustom letter-spacing is used only on a few special styles. The styles that it can be applied to are headers, bold weights and always to All Caps.\n\n**Letter-spacing: 0.5px**\n\n### Font-smoothing\n\nFont-smoothing is only used on bold weights (700). It is never used on thin (200) and light (300) weights.\n"

    "content": "**_Carbon Themes_ are used to customize components to fit the specific needs of a brand or product.**\n\n\n## Introduction to theming\n\nDevelopers and designers can use Carbon Themes to modify existing components to fit their own specific visual styles and needs. Rather than changing each individual component's css or building modified components from scratch, components can now be easily customized by changing a set of universal variables that seamlessly propagate across all of the components.\n\n***\n<a href=\"http://themes.carbondesignsystem.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Explore Themes</a>\n\n\n### Theme terms\n\nTerm | Definition\n-----|-----------\n**Theme** | The set of unique values assigned to the universal variables\n**Value** | A theme's unique styles (ie hex code, line weight etc) assigned to a universal variable\n**Role** | The systematic usage/s of a value. Roles cannot be changed between themes.\n**Variable** | The code identifier for a unique role or set of roles. Variables are universal and never change across themes.\n\n\n## IBM Cloud theme\n\nThe Carbon Design System has a default theme which is based off of the IBM Cloud UI and IBM Design Language. When `carbon-components` is downloaded and installed, they are preset to use the default theme.\n\nThe default theme acts as a starting point; from there designers and developers only need to define how their own components and styles deviate from the default. A theme can change all of the values or as little as only one. Those different values are then packaged into a new theme which when called will override the values of the default.\n\n\n***\n[Carbon Themes repo](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-themes)\n\n\n## Variables\nBy using variables developers only need to make a change in one place to see a system wide change. They are used across multiple components and make it easy for components to be systematically updated while keeping global patterns and styles consistent.\n\nAll variables come pre-baked into the Carbon component source code. Variables are denoted by the prefix `$` (eg. `$brand-01`).\n\nThere are two categories of variables: **color** and **global.**\n\n\n### Color\n\nEach theme is assigned 25 universal color variables, which are determined by [common roles and usage](http://www.carbondesignsystem.com/style/colors/usage). This allows for uniform color application across themes while giving each theme the freedom to express its own personality.\n\n\n```scss\n//// Carbon\n// Color Variables\n$brand-01: #3d70b2;\n$brand-02: #5596e6;\n$brand-03: #41d6c3;\n$inverse-01: #ffffff;\n$ui-01: #ffffff;\n$ui-02: #f5f7fa;\n$ui-03: #f0f3f6;\n$ui-04: #dfe3e6;\n$ui-05: #8c9ba5;\n$text-01: #152934;\n$text-02: #5a6872;\n$text-03: #5a6872;\n$field-01: #ebf0f7;\n$support-01: #e71d32;\n$support-02: #5aa700;\n$support-03: #efc100;\n$support-04: #5aaafa;\n```\n\n### Global\nThe second category is global variables. These control more general styling of components, such as layer usage or border width.\n\n```scss\n// Global\n$use-layer: true;\n$input-border: 1px solid transparent;\n$input-label-weight: 700;\n```\n\n## Theming applied\nThe following examples demonstrates the relationship between the different theming elements. Each element has a variable, a role, and a value determined by its theme.\n\n### Default theme applied\n\n![Default theme applied](images/theme-1.png)\n\n| Key | Variable            | Role               | Value                 | Theme   |\n|-----|---------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|---------|\n| 1   | $text-01            | Primary text       | #152935               | Default |\n| 2   | $text-03            | Hint text          | #5a6872               | Default |\n| 3   | $input-border       | Input border       | 1px solid transparent | Default |\n| 4   | $brand-01           | Primary icon       | #3d70b2              | Default |\n| 5   | $ui-02              | Default background | #f5f7fa               | Default |\n| 6   | $field-01           | Field background   | #152935 @ 10%         | Default |\n\n\n### Custom theme applied\n\nHere is the same component but with a different theme applied. Notice how only the values and theme items changed. The variables and role are the same for both.\n\n![Custom theme applied](images/theme-2.png)\n\n\n| Key | Variable            | Role               | Value            | Theme  |\n|-----|---------------------|--------------------|------------------|--------|\n| 1   | $text-01            | Primary text       | #272727          | Watson |\n| 2   | $text-03            | Hint text          | #777677          | Watson |\n| 3   | $input-border       | Input border       | 1px solid $ui-04 | Watson |\n| 4   | $brand-01           | Primary icon       | #047cc0          | Watson |\n| 5   | $ui-02              | Default background | #f6f6f6          | Watson |\n| 6   | $field-01           | Field background   | #ffffff          | Watson |\n"

    "content": "## Version 8.0.0 🎉\n**October 27, 2017**\n\nToday, we’re excited to announce our Version 8 (V8) release of the Carbon Design System!\n\nV8 marks the beginning of a full ecosystem behind Carbon. Carbon Components becomes the core library, with the new Add-on libraries bringing in product specific components and additional functionality. This release also contains Carbon updating to IBM Plex, the new IBM font, and migrating away from Helvetica Neue.\n\n### Ecosystem\n**Carbon Components**\n\n* [Carbon Components](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-components) is the core library for Carbon, now only containing generic and global components.\n* Carbon Add-ons are product specific components such as Interior Left Nav, Detail Page Header, and Cards.\n* Carbon has a growing number of add-on repos, including [Data Vis](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-addons-data-viz-react) and [Bluemix](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-addons-bluemix).\n* `carbon-eslint-config` / `carbon-eslint-react-config` are used on all repositories to synchronize code styles.\n* All repositories share a similar build release process, and all libraries ship with semantic-release.\n\n\n**Carbon Design Kit**\n\n* Reflecting the new ecosystem of Carbon, the V8 Design Kit now separates components from Add-ons.\n* Product specific templates have been removed and replaced with a variety of templates showcasing best practices in using Carbon Components.\n\n***\n<a href=\"https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-design-kit\" target=\"_blank\">Download the V8 Kit</a>\n\n### Typography\nCarbon now uses the new IBM open-sourced typeface, [IBM Plex](https://github.com/ibm/type). To use IBM Plex with Carbon components, simply toggle the scss variable `$css--plex` to true and the components will automatically update.\n\n```scss\n$css--plex: true;\n```\n\n* **Type styles** are pre-set configurations of typographic elements (font-size, weight, line-height, etc) and are most commonly used as headers. Each type style has an assigned CSS classname. These classes are independent of location or type of element, meaning you can use them anywhere. They are not restricted to a certain place in the code.\n* Carbon's **type scale** has been updated to complement IBM Plex.\n* Check out these updates and more on our [Typography](/style/typography) page!\n\n\n### Carbon website\nYou may have noticed an updated look and feel to our website. We're continually working to improve your Carbon experience, therefore we've made some small improvements:\n\n* Adding more tooling to our [Resources](/resources) page, such as our [CodePen](https://codepen.io/team/carbon/) and [React Storybook.](http://react.carbondesignsystem.com/?selectedKind=Accordion&selectedStory=Default&full=0&down=1&left=1&panelRight=0&downPanel=storybook%2Factions%2Factions-panel))\n* Writing clearer [Contributing](/guidelines/contributing) guidelines, to encourage outside design contributions.\n* Adding quick links and more informational content on the homepage.\n\n\n\nDon't hesitate to reach out to us with questions or feedback at carbon@us.ibm.com, or tweet us at [@_carbondesign](https://twitter.com/_carbondesign)!\n"
